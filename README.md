# Readable

Welcome to the 'Readable' app! It is a message board for all things React, Redux and Udacity! Happy posting :)

### Installation

Fork this repo, then (assuming you have npm) do the following:

```
npm install
```

### Getting Started

Once you've done the above, just type the following and your app will start up:

```
npm start
```

The Readable API server will also need to be running, and instructions to get that set up can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter).

### General Use
On the homepage you will see all posts split up by category (React, Redux or Udacity), with the ability to sort posts by timestamp or vote count, filter by category, add new posts, edit or delete existing posts, upvote or downvote existing posts, or go to the single post page. On the single post page you can edit or delete that post, add a new comment, upvote or downvote existing comments, or edit or delete existing comments.
